# UARC-Research-Project
Aviation Accident Vector Embedding
This project explores aviation accident reports using text embeddings, clustering, and visualization. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns across accidents based on narrative descriptions and metadata.

Project Structure
* vectorembedding.ipynb — Main Jupyter Notebook with the embedding workflow, clustering, and visualizations
* helpers.py — Helper functions for keyword extraction, clustering, and plotting

Key Features
* Generates text embeddings from NTSB accident narratives
* Reduces dimensionality using UMAP
* Groups similar reports with HDBSCAN clustering
* Explores relationships between clusters and metadata
